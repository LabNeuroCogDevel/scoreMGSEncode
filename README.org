* Score Memory Guided Saccades  
  - use STARTHERE_scoreEveryone.m
  - ignore RUNME_MGSEncodeAnalyze.m (for now)
    - should eventually take single eyd and score

* Pipeline
  see STARTHERE_scoreEveryone.m
** genxls.bash
     compiles list (subjectsID_date_run_visit_eyd_path_sex_age.txt) to be reordered into subjectlist_2013_04_22.xls
** MGSEncodeAnalyze*.m
  reads xls and outputs saccade list (saved as results)
** ProcessMGSEncodeResults
** RescoreMGSEncode
 
* Notes
- what are eccentricity and IQR metrics all about??
* TODO
- Scoring should be done iteratively instead of all at once

- genxls should write the finial xls
- MGSEncodeAnalyze should take an xls file as an argument
